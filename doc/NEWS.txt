GCN MemCard Recover v0.2
[released 2014/??/??]

Database statistics in this release:
- USA: 79 files
- PAL: 59 files
- JPN: 3 files
- KOR: 0 files :(
- Unlicensed: 1 file
- Homebrew: 1 file

- Stability has been improved. In particular, the custom model for
  the QTreeView now handles all required signals correctly.

- Some parts of the program now utilize C++ 2011 functionality.
  A compatibility header has been included for older compilers.

- The toolbar that was formerly located in the "Memory Card" view is
  now a window toolbar, and contains additional items, such as the
  "Preferred Region" selection.

- Added preliminary support for displaying scanning progress in the
  taskbar. Currently, only the D-Bus DockManager protocol is supported.
  Support for Ubuntu's Unity and Windows 7 will be added later.

- GcImage and Checksum functions have been split out into their own
  library, libgctools. This library depends on libpng but does not
  depend on Qt.

- Added support for the Qt translation system. Currently, the only
  translation included aside from the default en_US is a "1337"
  translation.
  (FIXME: Add translations included with v0.2)

- Fixed some corner cases with full memory card images and certain
  save files.

- Support for Japanese save files is improved.

- Added preliminary support for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++.
  The primary distributions will still be compiled with gcc/MinGW.

- Banners and icons can now be exported as image files. Banners and
  non-animated icons are always exported as PNG. Icons can be exported
  as APNG, GIF (FIXME: not implemented in v0.2?), PNG (file per frame),
  PNG (vertical strip), and PNG (horizontal strip).

- Added "Preferred Region" support. Some games don't have any way to
  determine the region by simply looking at the description, and in
  some cases, might be identical in every way other than the region
  code in the game ID. "Preferred Region" allows you to specify which
  region you want to prefer in the case that multiple save files in
  different regions are detected.

- Added support for multiple database files. The included databases
  are now split by region, e.g. USA, JPN, etc. Homebrew and Unlicensed
  titles are also contained in their own databases.

- Added a "top-secret" easter egg. :)

GCN MemCard Recover v0.1
[released 2013/07/21]

Database statistics in this release:
- USA: 59 files
- Unlicensed: 1 file
- Homebrew: 1 file

- Initial release.

- Supports extracting regular files from GCN memory card dumps.
  "Regular" files in this case means files that are normally
  visible in the system memory card manager.

- Supports searching for "lost" files in GCN memory card dumps.
  "Lost" files are files that aren't normally accessible because
  their file entries were removed, either due to corruption in
  the directory tables or accidental reformatting.

- Includes a database with 61 different file entries. This initial
  database only has NTSC-U games, and some file entries are not
  usable at the moment due to limitations in the scanning engine.

- Scanning engine cannot currently search for files whose descriptions
  are not stored in the first block of the file.

- Variable modification system does not yet support files with
  multiple slots whose slot IDs are not described in the file
  description field.
