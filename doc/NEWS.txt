GCN MemCard Recover v0.1
[released 2013/07/xx]

- Initial release.

- Supports extracting regular files from GCN memory card dumps.
  "Regular" files in this case means files that are normally
  visible in the system memory card manager.

- Supports searching for "lost" files in GCN memory card dumps.
  "Lost" files are files that aren't normally accessible because
  their file entries were removed, either due to corruption in
  the directory tables or accidental reformatting.

- Includes a database with 61 different file entries. This initial
  database only has NTSC-U games, and some file entries are not
  usable at the moment due to limitations in the scanning engine.

- Scanning engine cannot currently search for files whose descriptions
  are not stored in the first block of the file.

- Variable modification system does not yet support files with
  multiple slots whose slot IDs are not described in the file
  description field.
